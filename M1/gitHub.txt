#What is a Git Branch?

A branch is like a separate timeline or workspace in your project.

The main branch (main or master) is the “stable” version of your project.

When you create a branch, you get a copy of the code where you can work independently without affecting the main branch.

# 1. List all branches
git branch
# Shows local branches. Current branch has a *

# 2. Create a new branch
git branch new-feature
# Creates a branch called "new-feature" but stays on current branch

# 3. Switch to a branch
git checkout new-feature
# Or use modern command:
git switch new-feature

# 4. Create and switch in one command
git checkout -b new-feature
git switch -c new-feature

# 5. Delete a branch
git branch -d new-feature   # safe delete (only if merged)
git branch -D new-feature   # force delete

# 6. Push branch to remote
git push origin new-feature

# 7. Pull updates from remote branch
git pull origin new-feature

# 8. Merge branch into current branch
git checkout main
git merge new-feature


# Add a new remote account

If you want to push to another GitHub account, you can add a new remote or edit the existing one.

Add new remote:

git remote add neworigin https://github.com/newuser/repo.git


Push to new remote:

git push neworigin main
