Parent Container
<div class="flex justify-around items-end h-64 mt-10">


flex → Turns the container into a flexbox, allowing easy horizontal or vertical alignment of children.

justify-around → Horizontally distributes space evenly around each child element, leaving space on both ends.

items-end → Vertically aligns children to the bottom of the container.

h-64 → Sets the container height to 16rem (64 × 0.25rem).

mt-10 → Adds top margin of 2.5rem (10 × 0.25rem), pushing the container downward.

This container sets up the flex layout where the balls will sit at the bottom and bounce.

Ball 1
<div class="w-12 h-12 bg-red-500 rounded-full animate-bounce"></div>


w-12 → Width of 3rem (12 × 0.25rem).

h-12 → Height of 3rem (makes it a square to start).

bg-red-500 → Background color, a medium shade of red from Tailwind’s palette.

rounded-full → Makes the square a perfect circle.

animate-bounce → Built-in Tailwind bounce animation, moves element up and down continuously.

Ball 2
<div class="w-12 h-12 bg-green-500 rounded-full animate-bounce animation-delay-200"></div>


All classes same as Ball 1, except:

animation-delay-200 → Adds 0.2s delay before starting the bounce animation.

This creates a staggered effect, so the balls don’t bounce in sync.

Note: Tailwind default doesn’t include animation-delay-* classes. You might need to add it in Tailwind config or use inline style:

style="animation-delay: 0.2s;"

Ball 3
<div class="w-12 h-12 bg-blue-500 rounded-full animate-bounce animation-delay-400"></div>


Same as Ball 2, but the delay is 0.4s, making it bounce slightly after the first two balls.
